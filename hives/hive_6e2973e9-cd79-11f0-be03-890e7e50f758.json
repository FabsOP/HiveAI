Clarify the *core loop* you need to ship first\n\n| Element | What & Why | Quick win |\n|---------|------------|-----------|\n| **Signal source** | Use Apple Watch/Fitbit HRV + phone microphone (speech tone) \u2013 no custom hardware needed. | SDK already exists; no regulatory hurdles until clinical claims. |\n| **Mood classes** | Keep 3\u20115 simple, actionable moods: *Positive*, *Neutral*, *Low\u2011Energy* (expand to *Anxious*, *Agitated* later). | Easier model training, clear action mapping. |\n| **Action mapping** | 1) **Positive** \u2192 unlock new \u201cquest level\u201d or premium workout. <br> 2) **Neutral** \u2192 standard workout. <br> 3) **Low\u2011Energy** \u2192 gentle rehabbing circuit. | Demonstrates mood\u2011adaptivity without complex UI. |\n| **Avatar response** | Single avatar that changes colour/tempo according to mood. No heavy 3D rendering required. | One\u2011page UI/animation assets, quick iteration. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build the MVP \u2013 4\u2011step process\n\n| Step | Deliverables | Tools / Resources |\n|------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **1. Prototype the sensor\u2011to\u2011state map** | 1) Install watch SDKs on a small set of devices.<br> 2) Capture raw HRV and voice tone data. | Apple HealthKit, Fitbit SDK, open\u2011source Affectiva/Google Speech\u2011to\u2011Text. |\n| **2. Create a labelled training set** | 200\u2013300 users log daily mood in the app (Likert scale) + wear the device for 7\u202fdays. | Built\u2011in \u201cMood Journal\u201d feature. |\n| **3. Train & evaluate model** | End\u2011to\u2011end pipeline: feature extraction \u2192 ML classifier (e.g., Random Forest, tiny\u2011CNN). Target F1\u202f>\u202f0.8 on test set. | Python, scikit\u2011learn, on-device inference with Core ML / TensorFlow Lite. |\n| **4. Deploy & iterate** | On\u2011device deployment; real\u2011time mood updates \u2192 quest unlock / avatar change. | iOS/Android app in beta. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Regulatory & Privacy checkpoints\n\n| Issue | What to watch | Minimal action |\n|-------|---------------|----------------|\n| **Medical\u2011device classification** | If you make therapeutic claims (e.g., \u201creduces depression\u201d), it may fall under FDA 510(k) or EU MDR. | Review for *medical device* vs *well\u2011being* app; stay in \u201cgeneral fitness\u201d territory unless you add explicit therapy claims. |\n| **Data protection** | HRV, voice recordings, mood logs are PII (potential PHI). | Implement HIPAA\u2011/GDPR\u2011ready consent screens, encrypt at rest & in transit, limit location data to aggregate. |\n| **Haptic hardware** | Optional \u201canger\u2011shred\u201d wristband may be a medical device if you claim pain relief. | Keep it optional, label it \u201cnon\u2011clinical\u201d unless you certify separately. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Road\u2011map for added features (post\u2011MVP)\n\n| Feature | When & How |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Social mood\u2011gravity pool** | After 5k active users; aggregate emoji / mood codes only; use differential privacy for location. |\n| **Explosive \u201canger\u2011shred\u201d drills** | Only for users who have opted\u2011in; pre\u2011test for blood\u2011pressure impact. |\n| **Advanced avatar AI** | Use a lightweight emotion\u2011driven avatar (sprites + dynamic tempo) before moving to full 3D"
